HOW TO USE:

Click on Mapmaker.exe to boot up the program.

X and Y dimensions will refer to the X and Y dimensions of the final image.

"Detail" refers to the amount of circles that will be generated that will eventually form a final map.

Try 8000 as a start (The generation will only take a few seconds) and adjust from there.

The output will be placed in output.png.



ABOUT:

This is another iteration of my Mapmaker program, now imported onto C# as opposed to using Python. It runs much faster and the results are much better now.

Created March 2024.
